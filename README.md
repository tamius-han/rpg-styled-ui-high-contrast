# RPG Styled UI (High Contrast edition)

This is a fork of [Xbozon's RPG styled UI](https://github.com/Xbozon/rpg-styled-ui) theme. 

Original theme looks nice, but it doesn't provide enough contrast for some of my very bright maps. My changes to the theme aim to increase the contrast and provide some additional legibility (according to my subjective standards), even if that comes at the expense of aesthetics.

> Note: while the original theme has some support for pathfinder, I've only applied changes to the bits of the theme relevant to me.
